# Photoset Editor
The photoset editor was created as a WYSIWYG component in my new blog engine. The user can rearrange photos (by uploading them) in a grid via a simple drag'n'drop gesture. The project is inspired by Tumblr's photoset feature but has the advantage that it can handle unlimited photos and is open source.
